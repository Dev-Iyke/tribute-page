          <h3>Condolences</h3>
          <p>What a visionary leader. Steve Jobs will be missed. He embodied precision in beauty and beauty in precision. He showed us that we are best when we compete with ourselves. No one can replace him. No one will replace him. No one. </p>

          <h3>Rest in Peace</h3>
          <p>My deepest condolences to Steve and his family. I am new to the Apple family but it did not take long for me to get hooked. What Steve accomplished will be almost impossible to repeat if at all. This man was truly one of a kind and he will be missed by many. He had a vision and a dream then made them a reality. Rest In Peace Steve.</p>

          <h3>My biggest condolences</h3>
          <p>I don't know too many personal stories about Steve besides what the majority of the public already knows, but I feel that his death is the death of so many aspirations and excitement that the general public holds when Steve does what he does best.... reinventing the way we think, act, and communicate. May he rest in peace and with his Lord.</p>

          <h3>Dear Dad, Dear Steve</h3>
          <p>This past February, I lost my Dad to cancer. He was 59. I know all too well how empty the world can seem when we lose one of its greats.  Because sometimes, just sometimes, the world produces exemplary forces of light, and that is what they were. So when their light dims, it's as if the world goes dark.  But it's only a flicker. Sure, they're farther away - but their warmth,  radiance, and glow - still lights the way for the rest of us. To my Dad and to Steve - wherever you are - I see you flickering. You are still lighting up the world.</p>

          <p>Although I never knew Steve Jobs personally, he has been an inspirational figure in my life and I will always remain fond of his vision of the future for liberal arts and high technology.  </p>
